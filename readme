Description: process scheduling simulator

How to run program:
./master  [-t n] [-h]

n number of slave processes to execute
If n is over 18 it will be set to 18 for safety

Whats working:
- clock in shared memory
- PCB struct defined
- message queue between child and OSS
- printing to log file

Issues:
- couldn't get shared memory for PCB working
- couldn't figure out scheduling algorithms
- couldn't get queues working
- couldn't get statistics working

Starving algorithm:
- My aging algorihtm would probably work by giving all the queues a time quantum so
if a process hadn't been ran recently it would get pushed to the front of the queue
